# Personal Finance PowerBI Dashboard
A project that utilizes Microsoft PowerBI to analyze personal financial data and visualize expenses through an interactive dashboard.

# Problem Description
As one should, I have been keeping track of all mine or user's daily spending using Microsoft Excel. Using basic sorting/filtering in Excel I'm able to see a very high-level overview of user's spending. In order to perform data analysis at a more deeper level, we will turn my static Excel data into dynamic PowerBI dashboards.

Project Goals
Here are the questions I would like the PowerBI dashboards to answer:

- Monthly spending (in a given year).
- How much money spent per item category.-
- List all expenses with comments.
-Monthly and Yearly spending information.
- Monthly or yearly savings (in a given year).
- How much money save category.
- List all saving categories.
- Comparison of savings, expenses, earning of current year to previous year.

In order to answer these questions, I invested time in planning the PowerBI measures I would need to create and also planned a rough outline of the dashboard visuals I wanted.

Data Analysis Summary
Here are the dashboards that I created.

The program itself can be used both on a local machine (via Power BI "Desktop") and also on the cloud (via Power BI "Services"). It can be used in a similar fashion as how one may use Excel, but also provides the greater ability to more easily create interactive visualizations called 'dashboards'.
